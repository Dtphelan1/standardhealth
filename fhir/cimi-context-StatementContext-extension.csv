"Extension","","","",0,*,"","","","","SHR StatementContext Extension","Compositional and reusable grouping of clinical statement attributes that provides the context for the topic of a clinical statement.
The StatementContext class aligns with the SNOMED CT Situations with Explicit Context (SWEC) Concept Model. The StatementContext provides the expressivity required to specify that an act was performed or not performed or that a finding was asserted to be present or absent for the given subject of information. It also often holds provenance information relevant to the context of the clinical statement. It is important to note that by default the context applies to the conjunction of the attribute specified in the statement. For instance, if a clinical statement has a topic describing a rash on left arm and a context of 'absent', then the statement states that the subject of interest did not have a rash on the left arm but might have had one on the right arm.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Extension",0,1,"ele-1

title: "Mapping"
definition: "Each model in the SHR can be mapped to other standards to facilitate interoperability and transitions to the SHR. The translation of SHR to HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) profiles is defined using mappings. As a developer of clinical information models, in most cases, mapping happens behind the scenes."

title: "Data Element"
definition: "A data element is the simplest irreducible piece of a model, with name and a value. Data elements correspond to the fields properties in a FHIR resource. The value of a data element can be a primitive type, a group (complex data type, such as an address or body site), or a reference to an Entry. Unlike FHIR, in SHR, data elements are reusable."
